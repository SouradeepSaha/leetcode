# Leetcode Problem Solving Guide

## Main types of problems to solve:
- Dynamic Programming / Memoization
- Sliding Window
- Recursive / Backtracking

### Dynamic Programming Problems
The most popular types of dynamic programming problems are:
- Fibonacci Numbers:
  - Recurrence: F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
  - 1 Dimension cache using O(n) space
  - Can be solved with O(1) space in certain cases
- Zero/One Knapsack:
  - Each item can be used 0/1 times only
  - 2 Dimension cache using using O(n x m) space
- Unbounded Knapsack:
- Longest Common Subsequence
- Palindromes
